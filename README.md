android-guava
=============

Android-guava is a project to bring the best parts of guava to Android. The Optional class should make the process of handling errors in loaders or AsyncTasks that make http requests a little better. By requiring a check for an empty state, indicating an error occurred, your code will be less buggy and easier to follow.
